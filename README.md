# Giac, a free computer algebra system #

This repository provides a mirror for
[Giac](http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac.html).
It build scripts for compiling the C++ code to binaries (with Java, Android and iOS wrappers), and to JS using Emscripten (also including a GWT wrapper).

The repository also includes a NodeJS port that is no longer actively updated.
