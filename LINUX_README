This tutorial explains how to create a command line driven Linux version
of Giac. The steps have been tested under Linux Mint 17.2, Ubuntu
Linux 14.04 and Ubuntu 16.04.

Prerequisites
-------------

Install packages build-essential, libgmp-dev and libmpfr-dev.

Compilation and running
-----------------------

1. Enter

   $ ../gradlew run

2. After a successful compilation you should see something like

   Press CTRL-D to stop
   > Building 85% > :run

   Here you can type some examples and exit with CTRL-D.

Troubleshooting
---------------

You may want to remove the line "include giac-android" from the file
settings.gradle in order to avoid installing the whole Android SDK.
Also remove the tasks "androidCopyCrystaxSo" and "androidAar" from
the file build.gradle.
